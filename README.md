# amethyst
Amethyst is a systems language aimed at being simple, small, portable, and safe.

## Goals
 - Using refinement types to add compile time checks that can optionally be elevated to runtime checks
 - Using linear types for allocators in a region based memory management scheme as the primary memory management system
 - Hindley Milner type system with extensions
 - Simple but powerful
 - TODO: figure out a more concrete goals list
